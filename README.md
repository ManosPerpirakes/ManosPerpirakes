- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ManosPerpirakes
- I was born in 2007 in Greece. I can speak both greek and english. I have been learning python for over a year, during which time I have created various projects using modules such as pygame (video games) and PyQt5 (desktop applications). Most of them can be found in my repositories in this very platform. I am interested in working in other projects in order to acquire more experience (nonetheless they also fascinate me).
