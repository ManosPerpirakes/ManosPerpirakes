- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ManosPerpirakes
- I was born in 2007 in Greece. I can speak both greek and english. I have been learning python for over two years, during which time I have created various projects using modules such as pygame (video games), PyQt (desktop applications), pandas and kivy(mobile applications). Most of them can be found in my repositories in this very platform. I am interested in working in other projects in order to acquire more experience (nonetheless they also fascinate me).
